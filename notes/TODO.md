# EMACS PLAN

## QUESTIONS

- [ ] Orderless,vertico, marginalia, nerd-icons-completion, consult, embark, embark-consult, corfu, nerd-icons-corfu, cape, dabbrev. What are some issues that these package face with eglot
- [ ] Does corfu have native integration with eldoc
- [ ] How does lsp-mode view documentation.
- [ ] What will happen when cape-company-to-capf backend is provided to cape.
- [ ] How does paredit work?
- [ ] Are additional backends needed for cape and eglot
- [ ] Make apheleia autoformats buffers on have

## COMPLETION/DEVELOPMENT

- Desired Flymake Behaviour
  - [ ] Remove flymake posframe and add flymake-sideline

- [ ] Install tree-sitter grammaers directly using arch linux

## LaTeX tasks

- [ ] For the attached emacs configuration, setup yasnippet snippet inheritance, so that org-mode inheritaces the snippets from yas-define-snippets, keeping in mind the function yas-parent-mode does not exist
- [ ] Export org files to latex and pdf files
- [ ] Determine if texpresso-tonic can be used

## Programming modes

- LaTeX-mode
- python-ts-mode
- markdown-ts-mode

---

## TASKS

- [ ] **Make sure the following packages are working org source code blocks, first by manually checking, then adding if neccessary**
  - Completion System
  - Eglot, eldoc, dape, flymake
  - Alphaelia

- [x] **LaTeX**: [Add laas, auto-activating-snippets, cdlatex]
      Using the attached emacs configuration files as the base emacs configuration, write a comprehensive LaTeX writing environment in emacs 30 with the following features and integrations:
- integrate tectonic from <https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic>
- integrate texlab from <https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab> as the lsp backend for eglot.
- texlab and tectonic should work interchangeably wherever possible
- integrate org-mode and org-roam from the base emacs configuration into the writing environment.
- ability to write LaTeX documents both in org mode files and separate LaTeX files
- mimic the setup from doom emacs setup as closely as possible while not adding any redundant configuration options
- setup ligatures for LaTeX with additional math ligaturs
- setup cdlatex for quick math insertions, and setup laas and auto-activating-snippets.
- setup custom snippets that might be useful to quickly format and write LaTeX documents
- setup TeX-fold if writing separate LaTeX files
- integrate parsebib
- use pdf-tools as the default pdf viewer when compiling LaTeX files
- implement a robust citation and reference environment using citar-embark, citar-capf, org-roam-bibtex and citar-org-roam.

Make sure the LateX writing environment is integrated with the rest of the emacs configuration in the attached files. Make sure to search the web before writing anything. Do not introduce errors. You do not need to rewrite the whole emacs configuration. Only writet out latex writing environment and other needed changes in a nicely formatted and readble markdown output.
